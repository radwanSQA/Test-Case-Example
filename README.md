<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, postcondition developed for specific test scenario to verify any requirement. The test case includes specific variables or conditions, using which a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="10">1.Test case are need  to regular revision and update<br>
Anything changes or update in software requirements its directly affect the test case. So whenever requirements are updated/altered, TC need to be updated.<br>
2.Distribution TC among the other tester who will execute these<br>
Normally different tester test different function/components so TC are divide among the tester according to their areas.<br>
3.Test case have a tendency of interdependence<br>
Interesting and important behaviour of the TCs,denoting that they can but interdependent on each other. Form medium to large application with complex business logic, this tendence is more visible.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="17">1.Keep it simple but not too simple; make it complex but not too complex<br>
2.After documenting the test case,review once as a tester<br>
3.Bound as well as ease the tester<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="23">1.Composite steps<br>
Composite means when write any test case broken down it as many as possible steps.<br>
2.Application behaviour is taken as expected behavior<br>
3.multiple condition in one case</p>
